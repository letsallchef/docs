			<td><div class="ui green label">POST</div></td>
			<td>Create</td>
			<td>The POST verb is most-often utilized to **create** new resources. In particular, it's used to create subordinate resources. That is, subordinate to some other (e.g. parent) resource. In other words, when creating a new resource, POST to the parent and the service takes care of associating the new resource with the parent, assigning an ID (new resource URI), etc.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><div class="ui blue label">GET</div></td>
			<td>Read</td>
			<td>The HTTP GET method is used to **read** (or retrieve) a representation of a resource. In the “happy” (or non-error) path, GET returns a representation in XML or JSON and an HTTP response code of 200 (OK). In an error case, it most often returns a 404 (NOT FOUND) or 400 (BAD REQUEST). </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><div class="ui brown label">PUT</div></td>
			<td>Update / Replace</td>
			<td>PUT is most-often utilized for **update** capabilities, PUT-ing to a known resource URI with the request body containing the newly-updated representation of the original resource. However, PUT can also be used to create a resource in the case where the resource ID is chosen by the client instead of by the server. In other words, if the PUT is to a URI that contains the value of a non-existent resource ID. Again, the request body contains a resource representation. Many feel this is convoluted and confusing. Consequently, this method of creation should be used sparingly, if at all.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><div class="ui purple label">PATCH</div></td>
			<td>Update / Modify</td>
			<td>ATCH is used for **modify** capabilities. The PATCH request only needs to contain the changes to the resource, not the complete resource. This resembles PUT, but the body contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the server should be modified to produce a new version. This means that the PATCH body should not just be a modified part of the resource, but in some kind of patch language like JSON Patch or XML Patch.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td><div class="ui red label">DELETE</div></td>
			<td>Delete</td>
			<td>DELETE is pretty easy to understand. It is used to **delete** a resource identified by a URI.</td>
		</tr>
